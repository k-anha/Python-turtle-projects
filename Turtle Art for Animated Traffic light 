#hello today we are going to write a code in oython to draw animated traffic light 
#let's begin 
#first import turtle
import turtle
#in this case we also have to inport time module library
import time
#set your screen
screen=turtle.Screen() #remember to check your spelling and errors 
screen.title("Animated traffic light ")
screen.setup(width=200, height=400)

#now screen setup is done
#define a pen you can use any variable
#i am using "pen"
pen=turtle.Turtle()
#Function to draw a single traffic light
def draw_traffic_light(x,y,color):
    pen.penup()
    pen.goto(x,y)
    pen.pendown()
    pen.begin_fill()
    pen.color(color)
    pen.circle(50)
    pen.end_fill()
    
#Mainloop to animate traffic light
def animate_traffic_light():
    while True:
        draw_traffic_light(-150,0,"red")
        draw_traffic_light(0,0,"gray")
        draw_traffic_light(150,0,"gray")
        time.sleep(2)
        
        draw_traffic_light(-150,0,"gray")
        draw_traffic_light(0,0,"yellow")
        draw_traffic_light(150,0,"gray")
        time.sleep(1)
        
        draw_traffic_light(-150,0,"gray")
        draw_traffic_light(0,0,"gray")

        draw_traffic_light(150,0,"gray")
        time.sleep(1)
        
#function to draw outer boundary rectangele

#Setup pen
pen.speed(0)
pen.hideturtle()
#start animation

rectangle(-300,200,300,600,"yellow")
rectangle(-250,150,200,500,"orange")
animate_traffic_light()

#and that's all lets see it running
